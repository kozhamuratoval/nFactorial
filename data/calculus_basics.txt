Calculus Basics

1. Definite and Indefinite Integrals
A definite integral has specific bounds of integration and represents the area between the curve and the x-axis over a specific interval. An indefinite integral, also known as an antiderivative, represents a family of functions whose derivative is the integrand.

2. Mean Value Theorem
For a function f(x) that is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), there exists at least one point c in (a,b) where f'(c) equals the average rate of change of f over [a,b].

3. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The fundamental theorem of calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. It connects the concept of differentiating a function with the concept of integrating a function.

4. Limits and Continuity
A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. Continuity requires that a function be defined at a point, the limit exists at that point, and the function value equals the limit.

5. Derivatives
The derivative represents the rate of change or slope of a function at any given point. It can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
